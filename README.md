# Python-Discord: Revival Of Code 2022

Hello, This is the place I'm putting my answers in for the Revival of Code 2022.

I'm going to do this **Python** and (If possible) in my EsoLang, **NumberScript**

## Challenges

### Day 1: Santa Floor Tracker

#### link: https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1

#### folder: `/Day-1-Santa-Floor-Tracker`

#### Puzzle Description:
    
_Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time._

_An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor._

_The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors._

_For example:_

_(()) and ()() both result in floor 0._
_((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3._
_))((((( also results in floor 3._
_()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level)._
_))) and )())()) both result in floor -3._
_To what **floor** do the instructions take Santa?_
